# 2614Assign6
Assignment 6 for my C# class

This was the last assignment for my C# class that simulates a bank machine with Windows Forms.

Write a Windows Forms program that simulates a bank machine. Some of the specifications are rigid
and you must following them closely for full marks, while others are more flexible, giving you the
chance to decide how you want to implement the program. Do play with the sample program to get
an idea what the program should do.

# Program Restrictions
Some of these restrictions will keep the scope of the program reasonable so that it can be accomplished in the
allotted time, while others give you an opportunity to practice the techniques that you are learning in this course:

1. Your program must have the same forms as the sample program. You may enhance the look and
feel of the forms as long as they still reflect the GUI design principles that this course teaches
and as long as they still accomplish the same tasks as the ones in the sample program.
Be careful with the design of the dialogs.

2. You may add features to the program as long as the program still implements all of the
features in the sample program. For example, you could show an account's pending
balance—if it has one—as well as the balance.

3. The program has just one customer.

4. The customer has exactly three bank accounts. At least one must be a Savings account and
at least one must be a Line of Credit account. Hardcode any non-negative amount for their
opening balances and any amount greater than $0.00 to the lines of credit.

5. Write the BankAccount class in such a way that it assigns account numbers to new accounts
automatically, starting from account number 1001.

6. Although each account has an "Active" flag, accounts in this program never become inactive.
Having said that, you must still check this flag at the appropriate time and respond
accordingly.
